        <p class="speech"> What are you doing, Andrey? Are you reading? It's nothing, only
            I....</p>
        <p class="direction">[She opens another door, and looks in, then closes it]</p>
        <p class="speech">Isn't there any fire....</p>

        <h3 class="ANDREY">ANDREY</h3>
        <p class="direction">[Enters with book in hand]</p>
        <p class="speech">What are you doing, Natasha?</p>

        <h3 class="NATASHA">NATASHA</h3>
        <p class="speech"> I was looking to see if there wasn't a fire. It's Shrovetide,
            and the servant is simply beside herself; I must look out that something
            doesn't happen. When I came through the dining-room yesterday midnight,
            there was a candle burning. I couldn't get her to tell me who had
            lighted it. [Puts down her candle] What's the time?</p>
        
        <h3 class="ANDREY">ANDREY</h3>
        <p class="direction">[Looks at his watch]</p>  
        <p class="speech">A quarter past eight.</p>

        <h3 class="NATASHA">NATASHA</h3>
        <p class="speech"> And Olga and Irina aren't in yet. The poor things are still at
            work. Olga at the teacher's council, Irina at the telegraph office....</p>
        <p class="direction">[Sighs]</p>
        <p class="speech">I said to your sister this morning, "Irina, darling, you must
            take care of yourself." But she pays no attention. Did you say it was a
            quarter past eight? I am afraid little Bobby is quite ill. Why is he so
            cold? He was feverish yesterday, but to-day he is quite cold... I am so
            frightened!</p>

        <h3 class="ANDREY">ANDREY</h3>
        <p class="speech">It's all right, Natasha. The boy is well.</p>

        <h3 class="NATASHA">NATASHA</h3>
        <p class="speech">Still, I think we ought to put him on a diet. I am so afraid.
            And the entertainers were to be here after nine; they had better not
            come, Audrey.</p>

        <h3 class="ANDREY">ANDREY</h3>
        <p class="speech">I don't know. After all, they were asked.</p>

        <h3 class="NATASHA">NATASHA</h3>
        <p class="speech">This morning, when the little boy woke up and saw me he
            suddenly smiled; that means he knew me. "Good morning, Bobby!" I said,
            "good morning, darling." And he laughed. Children understand, they
            understand very well. So I'll tell them, Andrey dear, not to receive the
            entertainers.</p>

        <h3 class="ANDREY">ANDREY</h3>
        <p class="direction">[Hesitatingly]</p>
        <p class="speech">But what about my sisters. This is their flat.</p>
