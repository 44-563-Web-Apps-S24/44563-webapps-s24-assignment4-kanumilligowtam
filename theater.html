        <h1>Gowtam kanumilli does Chekov tonight</h1>
        <h2>THE THREE SISTERS Act 2 author Anton Chekov</h2>

        <p>[Scene as before. It is 8 p.m. Somebody is heard playing a concertina
            outside in' the street. There is no fire. NATALIA IVANOVNA enters in
            indoor dress carrying a candle; she stops by the door which leads into
            ANDREY'S room.]<br>
            
            NATASHA. What are you doing, Andrey? Are you reading? It's nothing, only
            I.... [She opens another door, and looks in, then closes it] Isn't there
            any fire.<br>
            
            ANDREY. [Enters with book in hand] What are you doing, Natasha?<br>
            
            NATASHA. I was looking to see if there wasn't a fire. It's Shrovetide,
            and the servant is simply beside herself; I must look out that something
            doesn't happen. When I came through the dining-room yesterday midnight,
            there was a candle burning. I couldn't get her to tell me who had
            lighted it. [Puts down her candle] What's the time?<br>
            
            ANDREY. [Looks at his watch] A quarter past eight.<br>
            
            NATASHA. And Olga and Irina aren't in yet. The poor things are still at
            work. Olga at the teacher's council, Irina at the telegraph office....
            [Sighs] I said to your sister this morning, "Irina, darling, you must
            take care of yourself." But she pays no attention. Did you say it was a
            quarter past eight? I am afraid little Bobby is quite ill. Why is he so
            cold? He was feverish yesterday, but to-day he is quite cold... I am so
            frightened!<br>
            
            ANDREY. It's all right, Natasha. The boy is well.<br>
            
            NATASHA. Still, I think we ought to put him on a diet. I am so afraid.
            And the entertainers were to be here after nine; they had better not
            come, Audrey.<br>
            
            ANDREY. I don't know. After all, they were asked.<br>
            
            NATASHA. This morning, when the little boy woke up and saw me he
            suddenly smiled; that means he knew me. "Good morning, Bobby!" I said,
            "good morning, darling." And he laughed. Children understand, they
            understand very well. So I'll tell them, Andrey dear, not to receive the
            entertainers.<br>
            
            ANDREY. [Hesitatingly] But what about my sisters. This is their flat.<br>
            
            NATASHA. They'll do as I want them. They are so kind.... [Going] I
            ordered sour milk for supper. The doctor says you must eat sour milk
            and nothing else, or you won't get thin. [Stops] Bobby is so cold. I'm
            afraid his room is too cold for him. It would be nice to put him into
            another room till the warm weather comes. Irina's room, for instance,
            is just right for a child: it's dry and has the sun all day. I must tell
            her, she can share Olga's room. It isn't as if she was at home in the
            daytime, she only sleeps here.... [A pause] Andrey, darling, why are you
            so silent?<br>

            ANDREY. I was just thinking.... There is really nothing to say..<br>

            NATASHA. Yes... there was something I wanted to tell you.... Oh, yes.
            Ferapont has come from the Council offices, he wants to see you.<br>

            ANDREY. [Yawns] Call him here.<br>

            [NATASHA goes out; ANDREY reads his book, stooping over the candle she
            has left behind. FERAPONT enters; he wears a tattered old coat with the
            collar up. His ears are muffled.]<br>

            ANDREY. Good morning, grandfather. What have you to say?<br>

            FERAPONT. The Chairman sends a book and some documents or other.
            Here.. [Hands him a book and a packet.]<br>

            ANDREY. Thank you. It's all right. Why couldn't you come earlier? It's
            past eight now.
