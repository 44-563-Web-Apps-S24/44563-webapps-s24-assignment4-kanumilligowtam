        <p class="speech"> They'll do as I want them. They are so kind....</p>
        <p class="direction">[Going]</p>
        <p class="speech"> I ordered sour milk for supper. The doctor says you must eat sour milk
            and nothing else, or you won't get thin.</p>
        <p class="direction">[Stops]</p>
        <p class="speech">Bobby is so cold. I'm
            afraid his room is too cold for him. It would be nice to put him into
            another room till the warm weather comes. Irina's room, for instance,
            is just right for a child: it's dry and has the sun all day. I must tell
            her, she can share Olga's room. It isn't as if she was at home in the
            daytime, she only sleeps here....</p>
        <p class="direction">[A pause]</p>
        <p class="speech">Andrey, darling, why are you
            so silent?</p>

        <h3 class="ANDREY">ANDREY</h3>
        <p class="speech"> I was just thinking.... There is really nothing to say....</p>

        <h3 class="NATASHA">NATASHA</h3>
        <p class="speech"> Yes... there was something I wanted to tell you.... Oh, yes.
            Ferapont has come from the Council offices, he wants to see you.</p>
        
        <h3 class="ANDREY">ANDREY</h3>
        <p class="direction">[Yawns]</p>  
        <p class="speech">Call him here.</p>

        <h3 class="NATASHA">NATASHA</h3>
        <p class="speech"> The Chairman sends a book and some documents or other.
            Here.... </p>
        <p class="direction">[Hands him a book and a packet.]</p>
        
        <h3 class="ANDREY">ANDREY</h3>
        <p class="speech">Thank you. It's all right. Why couldn't you come earlier? It's
            past eight now.</p>
